# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Build and open the desktop application with one command: `pnpm desktop`
  produces `dist/desktop/Open Cube.app` — the engine and the client in one
  bundle — and opens it; `pnpm desktop:install` also copies it into
  `/Applications`. It skips the dmg, which doubles the build for nothing when
  the point is to look at the window. The Swift bundle, the installer and CI
  are untouched.

- Add a terminal board: as many terminals as the work needs, in windows that
  open in a chosen sandbox, move, resize, raise, close and tidy into columns,
  with the arrangement restored on the next start.
- Let a terminal start a program. `claude`, `codex`, `qwen` and `agentctl` open
  a session that takes a task per line until `exit`. None launches its real
  binary — a program in a sandbox runs as the sandbox user, which needs the
  daemon — so what answers is the built-in inspector under the read-only
  policy, and the banner says so on every start, with the model, tokens and
  cost on every answer.
- Give a terminal one history wherever it is shown: the bottom panel and the
  board are two views of the same buffer, and the panel's session list includes
  the windows opened on the board.

- Design an agent by clicking: purpose, project, model, sandbox, review — one
  question per step, every answer a card. A purpose is an object in the engine
  now, and choosing one fills the instructions, patterns, skills, servers and
  tools; the review step shows what it filled and what the agent would be
  allowed to do. The old column of text fields is gone, and a test asserts no
  purpose names a pattern, skill, server or tool the library does not have.

- Make a project a first-class object in the engine and a tab in the window: a
  folder with its path, branch, working tree, first level of files and the
  agents pointed at it. Agents and projects are now checked against each other
  in both directions.
- Add "Open in editor": a menu of editors, each showing the exact command it
  would run against this folder, and saying plainly that resolving and
  launching an application belongs to the daemon. No editor claims to be
  installed, because nothing has looked for it.
- Add a new-project panel: from a template, a folder already on disk, or a
  repository. It prints the resulting path and every file and command involved
  before the button that would do any of it.
- Correct the prototype working tree, which claimed six changed files and
  listed four, and still named paths from the Swift layout. The tracked project
  and the reported working tree are now asserted to agree.
- Fix every filled button in the app: a later "lighter controls" rule had
  overridden the primary fill, so `Create`, `Save` and their kind were drawing
  white text on a transparent ground.

- Make the bottom dock a panel: `Problems`, `Output` and `Terminal` tabs, the
  sessions listed down the side instead of in a strip, a prompt that sits at
  the end of the stream, and a panel that maximises and restores. `Problems`
  gathers what the snapshot already says is broken — a model that is not
  connected, a skill whose permission is missing, a blocked server, a sandbox
  with no account, a module that is planned — each row naming where it was read
  from. `Output` keeps every refusal and reason the window reported, after the
  toast that carried it has gone.

- Rearrange the window the way VS Code arranges one: an activity strip of areas
  on the far left, a sidebar that shows whichever area is lit, and a work area
  of tabs that can be split so two surfaces sit side by side. Tabs drag between
  groups, opening something already open focuses it, and the arrangement —
  groups, tabs, lit area, sidebar width — is restored on the next start.
- Add search and source control to the sidebar: search reads the objects this
  window already holds, and source control shows the branch, the working tree
  and recent commits without going through the top menu.

- Replace Claude Sonnet with Claude Opus in the catalogue, at its own price per
  million tokens.
- Report three kinds of cost instead of one: metered per token, a subscription
  spread over the window, and the electricity a local run spends. Every row
  says which kind it is, the totals split the same way, and one local model is
  downloaded and working so its figure is real rather than hypothetical.

- Make the cost chip a small usage view: picking a period changes what it shows
  and keeps it open, while the panel presents every period at once with a model
  table carrying a column per window.
- Add an activity overview beside the calendar: the models the work ran on, and
  the split by kind of work — chat answers, agent runs, terminal commands and
  workflow steps — counted from the objects that hold them.
- Repair the stylesheet: a merge conflict resolved by concatenating both sides
  had truncated three rules, which silently killed every rule after them —
  including the whole activity calendar and part of the schema canvas.
  `pnpm build` now refuses to run on an unbalanced stylesheet.

- Restructure the repository into one cross-platform system: a Rust workspace
  (`crates/core`, `crates/app`) with one client in `web/`, driven from root
  `pnpm` scripts, recorded in ADR 008. The Swift app stays until the Rust
  runtime replaces it.
- Report spend over a chosen period — last hour, today, this week, this month —
  picked from the cost chip, and add an activity calendar: a year of days at
  five intensities with the same activity split per model.
- Add local run economics: for every model that can run on the device, the
  workbench estimates the time, energy, battery share and machine exploitation
  of a workload, and what running it locally saves against a reference API
  model. Computed in the core with tests, shown in Usage and on a local model's
  library entry, and labelled as an estimate with its formula.
- Restyle the client to a neutral design language: monochrome base with ink
  primaries, colour only for status, pill filters, underlined tabs, cards with
  footer strips, switches instead of add buttons, and an agent profile page
  with a display-size name and time-first activity rows.
- Move the client from Vite to Next.js with a static export, so the same
  interface builds for every platform and ships without a server.

- Rebuild the cross-platform desktop shell: chat-first main window, collapsible
  agent / sandbox / terminal / workflow / model rails, a workbench-API rail,
  a terminal dock, a command palette (`⌘K`) and a status bar that names its
  state source.
- Add light and dark themes driven by one token file, following the system
  appearance unless a theme is pinned; the stored choice applies before paint.
- Move desktop state into the Rust engine: agents, sandboxes with mounts,
  network policy and processes, a model catalogue with pinned versions and
  digests, terminal sessions, the workflow graph, the workbench API listing,
  usage accounting and version control, all covered by engine tests.
- Add an in-app inspector: the main chat answers from the engine snapshot under
  a read-only policy, reports model, version, tokens, cost and the objects it
  read, refuses workspace files, credentials and terminal input, and redacts
  secret terms. No answer leaves the machine.
- Add a terminal dock (`⌘J`) that answers engine-backed commands per sandbox and
  refuses anything needing a live pty, a canvas workflow editor with drag, link,
  zoom and pan, a sandbox boundary visualisation, a model catalogue with version
  control, and a usage and cost view.
- Add the agent studio: create an agent from a project, model and sandbox, then
  edit its blueprint — instructions, patterns, skills, MCP servers and engine
  tools — from a library that explains each entry and what it requires, with the
  resulting sandbox requirements derived and blocked ones named.
- Turn the model catalogue into a library: each model carries a summary, what
  it is good at, its requirements, its licence and one reference — Hugging Face
  for open weights, the provider's API documentation for hosted models — opened
  in the system browser, with filters for local, API and ready-to-use.
- Give every model its own icon, accent, pinned version and revision history;
  surface version control in the top bar next to the branch.
- Generate the browser preview snapshot from the engine (`pnpm fallback`) so the
  preview cannot drift from Rust.
- Drop the Google Fonts import and bundled icon assets; the shell makes no
  network request and draws its icons inline.
- Ship the shell as a native window: transparent macOS window with
  `underWindowBackground` vibrancy, overlay title bar, the top bar as drag
  region, and translucent chrome that follows the window material.
- Paint the app's own theme as the ground in the native window and sync the
  window appearance with it, so a light theme stays light on a dark desktop;
  raise the blur and lower the transparency of every chrome layer.
- Add the account menu at the bottom of the left rail, a workspace bar for an
  open agent (project, branch with switcher, working tree, chats) and one line
  of context — model, state, branch — under each agent.
- Quiet the interface: one-line rail rows, answer provenance and counts on
  hover, a five-item status bar, the workbench API rail and terminal dock closed
  on first run, and safety flags — refusals and redactions — always visible.
- Remove leftovers from the previous shell: dead components, unused primitives
  and dead CSS rules, plus the stale layout descriptions in `.ai/`.
- Record the decisions in `.ai/adr/005`, `.ai/adr/006` and `.ai/adr/007`, with
  specs for the inspector, terminal, canvas, model catalogue and usage
  accounting.
