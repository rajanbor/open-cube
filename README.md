A native macOS app and CLI for running **Codex and Claude Code as a separate
standard macOS user**. Local projects, explicit permissions, native Metal access.
No VM, Electron, cloud backend, telemetry, or bundled agent credentials.

The macOS app is evolving into an open agent desktop: named parallel sessions,
an inspected local-computer profile, a local-model compatibility catalog and
connection controls. Docker, Gemini execution and provider API-key storage are
visible in the interface but are not yet launchable; the existing `agent` user
runtime remains the supported execution path.

## One cross-platform system

The product is a Rust workspace with one web client, described in
[ADR 008](.ai/adr/008-one-cross-platform-system.md):

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/core` | Domain, workbench state and the inspector policy. Platform neutral, carries the tests. |
| `crates/runtime` | The launch contract and the account boundary, with platform adapters. |
| `crates/cli` | `open-cube`: read the workbench, and see what a launch would do. |
| `crates/app` | The Tauri window for macOS, Windows and Linux. |
| `web/` | The client: React and TypeScript, light and dark themes. |
| `Sources/`, `scripts/` | The Swift macOS app and its installer, retired once the Rust runtime lands (#32, #33). |

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm desktop            # build the application and open its window
pnpm desktop:install    # …and copy it into /Applications
pnpm app                # the window against the dev server, for development
pnpm dev                # the client in a browser tab, for quick iteration
pnpm test               # cargo test --workspace
```

`pnpm desktop` produces `dist/desktop/Open Cube.app` — the Rust engine and the
client in one bundle, opened from Finder like any other application. The
browser tab is a preview: it runs the same client against a generated snapshot
and labels itself `preview snapshot`, where the application reads the engine
and says `rust engine`.

The `Open Cube.app` that the current installer ships is still the Swift client;
it is replaced when [#33](https://github.com/rajanbor/open-cube/issues/33)
retires it.

The window opens on a chat with an in-app inspector that answers from the
engine snapshot — what each agent is doing, what runs in each sandbox, which
model version was used and what it cost — under a read-only policy that refuses
file contents and credentials and never reaches the network. Around it sits a
VS Code arrangement: an activity strip, a sidebar that shows one area at a time
— agents and their chats, search, source control, sandboxes and terminals,
models, workflows — and a work area of tabs that split side by side. In those
tabs: the chat, a terminal dock, a canvas workflow editor, a sandbox boundary
view, a model library, usage and the agent studio, with the workbench-API rail
beside them.

It does not launch agents, providers, ptys or Docker yet: that is the Swift app
above, until `crates/runtime` and `crates/cli` take it over.

See [the cross-platform migration design](.ai/architecture/CROSS_PLATFORM_MIGRATION.md) for the
platform-specific security plan.

AI-assisted product, architecture and implementation work is governed by
[`.ai/README.md`](.ai/README.md), with the delivery order in the
[Open Cube roadmap](.ai/roadmap/ROADMAP.md). Repository-wide instructions for
agents are in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

## Quick start

Requires macOS 14+ and a main account authorized to use sudo. Apple Silicon and
Intel are supported by one universal installer. Agent tools require their own provider login.

1. Open the [download page](https://rajanbor.github.io/open-cube/) and click **Pobierz na macOS**.
2. Open the `.pkg` and follow macOS Installer. The app is installed into `/Applications`.
3. Open **Open Cube → Skonfiguruj Maca**. The guide opens Terminal; answer
   its prompts without typing shell commands.
4. Use **Zaloguj Codex** / **Zaloguj Claude**, then add your first project.

Open **Sesje → Nowa sesja** to create a Codex, Claude, or Terminal session for
one project. Each one opens a separate native control window in Open Cube;
the interactive tool remains in Terminal, where macOS handles the account switch.

The app prepares the user-scoped launcher and `~/.local/bin/agentctl` on launch.
The guide asks before creating an account, granting workspace access,
restricting the main HOME or installing agent tools. Existing account passwords
and existing projects are preserved. Passwords are handled by sudo/sysadminctl.
The `.pkg` has no privileged install scripts: account creation and permission
changes happen only through the separate guide. It requires no Xcode or ZIP extraction.
Open the new copy from `/Applications` after upgrading from a manual installation
in `~/Applications`; projects and settings are shared and preserved.

The app is ad hoc signed; the installer is unsigned and **not notarized**. macOS may require you to review the
download in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway. We do not
disable Gatekeeper or remove quarantine attributes. Apple Events consent for
Terminal/iTerm is also handled by macOS.

The source guide can also be previewed from a checkout:

```sh
bash scripts/quickstart.sh --dry-run
```

## Build from source

Requires Swift 6 / Xcode 16 or newer (a compatible Command Line Tools install
also works). Install Apple's tools with `xcode-select --install` if missing and
finish the system installer before continuing.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rajanbor/open-cube.git
cd open-cube
bash scripts/quickstart.sh
```

Build without installing or changing the machine:

```sh
swift test
bash scripts/build-app.sh
```

## Separate setup steps

Each script can be reviewed and run independently:

```sh
bash scripts/install.sh --dry-run
bash scripts/install.sh
bash scripts/setup-macos.sh                 # preview only
bash scripts/setup-macos.sh --apply         # prompts before each change
bash scripts/install-agent-tools.sh         # preview only
bash scripts/install-agent-tools.sh --apply
open "$HOME/Applications/Open Cube.app"
```

The setup creates standard `agent` only if missing, uses
`/Users/Shared/AgentWork`, and offers a targeted ACL denying that account access
to your main HOME. It does not grant admin, sudo, Docker access or Full Disk
Access; it does not copy credentials or change sudoers. Do not sign the agent
account into iCloud.

Agent tools install under `/Users/agent/.local`. The script installs a
checksum-pinned Node release if required, uses a user-local npm prefix, and adds
one PATH line to **agent's** `.zprofile`. It never runs `sudo npm`.

Log in to your providers separately:

```sh
sudo -iu agent
codex login
claude
exit
```

See [OpenAI's CLI guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/) and
[Anthropic's installation guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/installation).

## Use

Add an existing directory inside AgentWork, or choose a trusted source repository
and preview an isolated copy. Select the project and click Codex, Claude or
Terminal. The terminal explains its sudo password prompt; startup errors also
appear in the project panel.

To import one of your GitHub repositories, choose **Dodaj projekt → GitHub**.
Install [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) first if it is not already on your
Mac. The app opens its official login in your browser, lists personal,
organisation and collaborator repositories available to the connected account,
available to that account, and creates an isolated workspace after you choose
one. Private repositories work when the connected account can read them. GitHub
credentials stay in the main account's Keychain; the agent gets no token, remote
origin, or credential configuration. Review the selected repository as trusted
before importing it.

```sh
~/.local/bin/agentctl list
~/.local/bin/agentctl status
~/.local/bin/agentctl add /absolute/path/to/trusted-repository
~/.local/bin/agentctl codex example
~/.local/bin/agentctl claude example
~/.local/bin/agentctl open example
~/.local/bin/agentctl sessions example
~/.local/bin/agentctl stop example
~/.local/bin/agentctl remove example
```

If you already have another `agentctl`, the installer refuses to overwrite it.
The installed runtime CLI is also available at
`/Users/Shared/AgentWorkbench-<main UID>/agentctl`.

## How isolation works

A normal Git worktree in a private source repository still depends on that
repository's `.git`. Our creator makes an independent bare clone with
`--no-local`, removes its source remote, then creates a worktree from that copy.
Only committed history is imported; uncommitted files, credentials and source
configuration are not copied. There is no automatic merge/sync back to source.

Launches switch UID through `sudo -iu agent` with a clean environment.
Canonical paths and private-directory access are checked again as agent.
Git status also runs as agent because Git filters can execute repository code.
The main-owned launcher is not setuid and has no privileged service.

## Known limits

- No enforced network/per-project sandbox. Other agent-readable files remain
  readable; localhost services may expose data. Lando status is not queried.
- `sudo -n` diagnostics report Unknown without authorization. Run `sudo -v`
  then `agentctl status` in the same terminal. GUI authorization may differ.
- Session state is advisory. Stop sends SIGTERM to the supervisor's own child
  group; daemonized descendants may remain. No automatic SIGKILL.
- `remove` confirms and archives direct workspace children, retaining source
  repositories and isolated Git metadata. It does not permanently delete them.
- Import assumes a trusted source and no concurrent manipulation of destinations.
  This alpha does not promise protection against every filesystem race.
