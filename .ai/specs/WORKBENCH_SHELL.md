# Spec: workbench shell

Acceptance: the app opens on a chat backed by the in-app inspector; one
navigation column carries what can be started, the areas of the workbench as
rows, and whichever area is open, in collapsible sections reflecting live
state; the work area holds tabs
that can be split so two groups sit side by side, and the arrangement is
restored on the next start; the right rail lists values, functions and
modules with the inspector policy; the account sits at the foot of that column with
settings beside it; opening an agent shows its project, branch, working tree and chats,
and can start another chat; the terminal dock opens, resizes and hides without
losing its buffer; the canvas edits a workflow; the sandbox view draws
the isolation boundary; the model catalogue shows each model's identity, pinned
version and revisions, and version control is reachable from the top bar; usage
reports tokens and cost per model, per agent and per day; light and dark themes
render every view from the token file; the native window is translucent, drags
by its top bar and leaves room for the traffic lights; sidebar rows stay one line
with detail on hover, the API rail and dock start closed, and no disclosure
shifts layout; every control for an unimplemented capability reports why.

## Prototype status

Implemented in `web/`: a Next.js App Router entry over `src/`, split into `components/`, `views/`, `lib/`,
`data/` and `styles/`. The shell is `Sidebar` and `EditorGroups` over
`lib/layout.ts`, which owns the tab model and its persistence. State comes from the Rust engine
(`desktop_snapshot`, `inspector_ask`) under Tauri, and from the generated
`src/data/prototype-snapshot.json` in a browser preview; the status bar and the
top bar name which source is in use.

`pnpm desktop` builds the application bundle and opens it; `pnpm app` runs the
same window against the dev server. The browser preview is for quick iteration
and labels itself "preview snapshot".

Not implemented: launching providers, live ptys, running workflows, persisting
notes or workflows beyond local storage, and remote machines.
